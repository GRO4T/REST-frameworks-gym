# REST-frameworks-gym
The goal of the projects is to compare various REST frameworks
by creating simple RESTful backends which will contain:
* user authentication
* working with a database
* serving static files
* API documentation (Swagger)

Frameworks will be compared based on:
* ease of development
* features
* performance

All backends will communicate with a React frontend. Application state will be stored in a MongoDB. Everything will be served behind an NGINX server.
